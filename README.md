# A Purple Reunion

My buddy Redless wrote a short murder mystery, [A PURPLE REUNION](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14QN2NuCTMQZEr1I9iG_cab3plNpUbOJdPQKkNDj0AzA/edit). It's very mechanical and you can deduce the killers using only a small set of clues. I thought it'd be fun to encode the clues in a language understandable by an SMT solver and see if it was any good as a detective â€“ it did pretty well!

Once you've installed `Z3` and Haskell's `Stack` tool (easily available through ghcup), just run `stack run` inside this directory to see what it thinks.
